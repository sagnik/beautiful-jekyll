My full name is Sagnik Ray Choudhury. Pronounced [shaagh-neek rye chou-dhoo-reeh](https://www.nameshouts.com/names/bengali/pronounce-sagnik-ray-choudhury).

- I love fish, scotch, NLP, Python, Scala and Bukowski. In that order. And Github. 
- I hate [Perl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl) and [BJP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatiya_Janata_Party). Not necessarily in that order.
- Fuck Perl. Did I mention that?    

What else do you need?

### my history

I work for a company called [Interactions](https://www.interactions.com/). We use AI to build IVR and Chatbots. We also build AI models to mine social networks. 

I have a PhD from [IST, PennState](http://ist.psu.edu/). My primary advisor was [Dr. C. Lee. Giles](http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu). I also worked with [Dr. Prasenjit Mitra](http://www.personal.psu.edu/faculty/p/u/pum10/). 

Before coming to PennState, I spent all my years in India. I have a bachelor's and master's degree in CS from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in) and [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), respectively.

In my current job I write [deep learning models for NLP in Python](https://github.com/dpressel/baseline). My [Ph.D. research](http://www.personal.psu.edu/szr163/research.html) involved information extraction from scholarly papers.
